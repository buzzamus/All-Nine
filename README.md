# All-Nine

#### A small exercise app for experimenting with passing state between views in SwiftUI and learning XCTest testing framework.


Q: Why 1-9 instead of the typical 1-10 in Break the Box?
A: Because this isn't Break the Box. It is All Nine. A completely different game. Plus 1-9 looks better on an Apple Watch. Next question.
